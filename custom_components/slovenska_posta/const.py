# Every optional key the parcel contract defines. CAPABILITIES below must be a
# subset of this — it exists so a typo in CAPABILITIES fails a test instead of
# silently dropping a carrier off a table on the docs site.
KNOWN_CAPABILITIES = frozenset(
    {"weight", "dimensions", "delivery_window", "pickup_point", "url", "history"}
)

# The documented /tracking surface has no ETA, weight or dimensions — only
# status/history, a pickup-point object on the relevant event, and the deep
# link built from the barcode. Every value not listed here comes back as a
# literal ``None`` from normalize_parcel() in parcels.py. The docs site's
# carrier comparison table is generated straight from this constant, so
# drift here does not stay a local mistake, it becomes a wrong claim on the
# website.
CAPABILITIES = frozenset({"pickup_point", "url", "history"})

# If this carrier ever grows a second backend with a genuinely different
# payload shape (a country-specific API, not just a config option), replace
# the single CAPABILITIES above with a CAPABILITIES_BY_VARIANT dict instead:
#
#   CAPABILITIES_BY_VARIANT = {
#       "Germany": frozenset({"pickup_point", "url", "history"}),
#       "Other": frozenset({"weight", "dimensions", "delivery_window",
#                            "pickup_point", "url", "history"}),
#   }
#
# Key order is display order on the docs site's comparison table; label each
# key exactly as the carrier's own country/backend selector does. The docs
# site's generator accepts either shape — don't declare both. Do not add this
# preemptively: a single-backend carrier (the common case) keeps the flat
# CAPABILITIES above.

# ``TRACKING_API_URL`` is the consumer tracking endpoint the integration
# polls — public, keyless, batchable: ``q=`` takes up to 100 comma-separated
# tracking codes per the official manual (``{codes}`` is pre-joined and
# URL-escaped by api.py), ``l=en`` asks for English event text, ``p=1``
# includes the ``postOffice`` object on relevant events. The response is
# ``{"status": ..., "results": [...]}`` — one entry per requested code, each
# carrying its own ``number``/``status``/``events``; match back by
# ``number``, never by array position (the manual doesn't promise order is
# preserved). A per-code ``status: "invalid_format"`` means that code was
# rejected as malformed by the carrier itself, not "not found" — api.py
# drops those from its result before the coordinator ever sees them, so one
# never becomes a normalised parcel. Do **not** call
# ``https://api.posta.sk/private/web/track`` — it currently answers
# unauthenticated too, but is undocumented, has a different ``{parcels[]}``
# schema and is not the carrier-supported contract.
#
# ``TRACKING_URL`` is the human-facing deep link surfaced on each parcel's
# ``url`` field — the current public tracker's own English URL, confirmed
# live (not the legacy ``tandt.posta.sk/zasielky/<code>`` path, which still
# 301-redirects here but is one hop slower for no benefit now the current
# path is known).
